This is an anonymous function (also known as a lambda expression or inline function) in JavaScript. Let's break it down:

- **`function(){ ... }`**: This is the standard syntax for defining a function in JavaScript. The `function` keyword signals the start of a function definition. The parentheses `()` are where you would normally define the function's parameters.

- **`return a+b;`**: This is the body of the function. It calculates the sum of `a` and `b` and then `return`s that value. Critically, `a` and `b` are _not_ defined within the function. This makes this function rely on variables `a` and `b` being defined in an _outer scope_ (either globally, or within the scope in which this anonymous function is defined and called).

**How it works (and its limitations):**

To actually use this function, you need to:

1.  **Assign it to a variable:** So you can call it.
2.  **Ensure `a` and `b` are defined in the surrounding scope:** The function needs to be able to access `a` and `b`.

**Example:**

```javascript
let a = 5;
let b = 10;

const myFunc = function () {
  return a + b;
}; // Assign the anonymous function to myFunc

let result = myFunc(); // Call the function
console.log(result); // Output: 15

a = 20; // change the value of a
result = myFunc();
console.log(result); // Output: 30 (because the function references the *current* values of a and b)
```

**Alternative (and often better) approaches:**

The above approach works, but it's generally _better_ to pass the values of `a` and `b` _as parameters_ to the function. This makes the function more reusable and less dependent on external state, reducing the chances of unexpected behavior:

```javascript
const betterFunc = function (a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

let result2 = betterFunc(5, 10);
console.log(result2); // Output: 15

result2 = betterFunc(20, 30);
console.log(result2); // Output: 50
```

**ES6 Arrow Function (Concise syntax):**

The example above can be further simplified using an ES6 arrow function:

```javascript
const arrowFunc = (a, b) => a + b;

let result3 = arrowFunc(5, 10);
console.log(result3); // Output: 15
```

**In Summary:**

The original code defines an anonymous function that adds two variables, `a` and `b`, which must be defined in an outer scope. While this works, it's generally preferable to define functions that accept arguments as parameters for better reusability and predictability. Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for defining simple functions like this.
